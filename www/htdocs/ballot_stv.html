    This is a ballot with <span id="cnum">N</span> nominated members and
    <span id="snum">N</span> board seats available.
    The red line denotes the cutaway, should all your choices be voted in.
    All the nominees are placed in random order on the canidate list.
    If the canidate has prepared a statement, you can view it by clicking on the
    statement link to the right of the candidate's name.
</p>
<p>
    <b>How to vote:</b><br/>
    Drag a candidate from the candidate list to the ballot box to place them in
    the vote. You can rearrange your votes as you see fit, by dragging
    candidates up/down on the ballot box list. You may place as many canidates
    in the ballot box as you see fit. If you want to
    remove a single candidate from your ballot box, simply drag the
    canidate back to the list of remaining candidates to the left.
