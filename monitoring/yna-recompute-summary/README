These scripts parse a maildir that contains (among other things) the
notification mails sent by voter@ after each and every vote, and generate:

* For multiple votes with the same hash, list them
  (because no one implemented date-based choice of the most recent vote yet)

* Display the results (modulo those warnings)

These can then be compared with the tallies sent by the voter script upon
close_issue.
