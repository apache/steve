These scripts parse a maildir that contains (among other things) the
notification mails sent by voter@ after each and every vote, and generate:

* For multiple votes with the same hash, list them
  (because no one implemented date-based choice of the most recent vote yet)

* Display the results (modulo those warnings)

These can then be compared with the tallies sent by the voter script upon
close_issue.


INSTRUCTIONS:

* Unpack a maildir containing the vote mails somewhere
* Run driver.sh with /path/to/maildir as argv[1]

* driver.sh is the only one marked 'executable' in the repository.  That's intentional.
